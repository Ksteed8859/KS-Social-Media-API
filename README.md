# KS Social Media API

## Description

This project uses MongoDB to allow users to create or delete new users or posts using a program that tests API ends, such as Insomnia. While the routes are there to add/delete friends and reactions, they are not functional as of 3/14/23.

## Installation

This program uses Express and Mongoose to properly run. You can install them by running ```npm i``` in the terminal after cloning the repository.

To start the program, type in ``` npm run start ``` into the terminal. Then use a program that tests API ends, such as Insomnia, to see the program in action.
